For my [CESI Masters degree](https://www.cesi.fr/en/) in software development at Aix-en-Provence I had the opportunity to work at [Saint Gobain](https://www.saint-gobain.com/en) R&D Centers as a software developer for all laboratories:
My work included working for laboratories in France, Germany, China, Brazil, and the USA. Helping in automating result entry from different material analysis in labs, data analysis, and report generation.
Some notable technologies that i used during my time at Saint Gobain were:

- .NET Ecosystem / C# (.NET Framework, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core)
- RDBMS such as OracleDB, SQL Server, AzureSQL
- Cloud services such as [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us), notably [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops), [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-factory)
- Web technologies to interface with the LIMS RDBMS as well as admin tooling such as [Angular](https://angular.dev/), ASP.NET Core Minimal API, [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).
